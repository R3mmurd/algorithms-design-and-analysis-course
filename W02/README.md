# Week 2

- [qs.C](qs.C) contains a program that counts the number of times that the quicksort
- algorithm makes comparisons. The goal of this is to study the importance of making
  a good pivot selection. It uses the library [Aleph-w](https://sourceforge.net/projects/aleph-w/).

- [QuickSort.txt](IntegerArray.txt): Contains given data for an array.

- [Makefile](Makefile): to compile [qs.C](qs.C).
