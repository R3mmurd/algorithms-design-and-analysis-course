# Week 4

- [bfs.H](bfs.H) contains algorithms based on the breadth-first traversal of graphs.

- [dfs.H](dfs.H) contains algorithms based on the depth-first traversal of graphs.

- [scc.C](scc.C) contains a program that uses the
  [Kosaraju's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosaraju%27s_algorithm)
  to find the strongly connected components of a directed graph.
  It uses the library [Aleph-w](https://sourceforge.net/projects/aleph-w/).

- [SCC.txt](SCC.txt): Contains given data to build a directed graph.

- [Makefile](Makefile): to compile [scc.C](scc.C).
