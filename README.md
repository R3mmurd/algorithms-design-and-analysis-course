# Algorithms: Design and analysis part 1

This repository contains my solutions for the homeworks in this course.
You should not use these codes for your own solutions in case you are doing the
course. But you could study them for learning purposes.

Note: This course has been relaunched as part of a [Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms).

This course was an introduction to algorithms for learners with at least a little programming experience.  The course was rigorous
but emphasizes the big picture and conceptual understanding over low-level implementation and mathematical details.

Specific topics include: "Big-oh" notation, sorting and searching, divide and conquer (master method, integer and matrix multiplication,
closest pair), randomized algorithms (QuickSort, contraction algorithm for min cuts), data structures (heaps, balanced search trees,
hash tables, bloom filters), graph primitives (applications of BFS and DFS, connectivity, shortest paths).

The structure of this repository contains the code developed for each week as follows:

- **[W01](W01/README.md)**: Introduction; "big-oh" notation and asymptotic analysis; divide-and-conquer basics.

- **[W02](W02/README.md)**: The master method for analyzing divide and conquer algorithms; the QuickSort algorithm
  and its analysis; probability review.

- **[W03](W03/README.md)**: Linear-time selection; graphs, cuts, and the contraction algorithm.

- **[W04](W04/README.md)**: Breadth-first and depth-first search; computing strong components; applications.

- **[W05](W05/README.md)**: Dijkstra's shortest-path algorithms; heaps; balanced binary search trees.
